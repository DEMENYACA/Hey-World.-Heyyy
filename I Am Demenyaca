        One of my <EM>greatest strength </EM> is my patience. I have the patience of a Lioness stalking her kill.   I have perservered through the most severe of  PTSD and physical and mental challanges, and still I stand.  My thresh for pain is higher than usaul whether it is <em> emotional or physical</em> pain, has allowed me to continually press forward.  What I mean is, I can feel the burn of a situaton, and continually exercise <em>"the muscle"</em>. I'm also a  recovering fear addict when fear is waved in my face, my first temptation  is to take <em>a hit</em>! Then later, I'm left with the guilt of loosing out on very beneficial outcomes! Which I've heard is called <strong>Feeling the fear and doing it anyway. So, I will just do it anyway!

 <h2><strong><em>D</em> is for Destination <em>KNOWN.</em> </strong> </h2> <br>
    
<h3>Today, I'm riding high on the fear and anxiety recovery train and it's a calmer ride. I'm determined more than I've ever been to build up my life again.  My sense of self-awareness and self-worth has greatly improved! Each day, I acknowledge that I have the power to improve <em>my</em> life. I have ALL the tools necessary to live the next half of this life the <strong>best</strong> way that I possible can. Surprisingly or not so much, I've always had these mysterious tools just <em>too</em> afraid to use them. 
<br>
        
       
 As I've thought about entering coding bootcamp, I've evaluated my strengths against the forces that await me <em>beyond the wall</em>. As advised I plan to have a  goal of where I'd like to end up, then use boot camp to carve out a path to that destination. I feel bootcamp is a good starting position for me continue toward entry level careers in the IT industry. <br>
       
 <br>
Coding is good for me because it demands preciseness. It teaches a certain discipline that I can't learn anywhere else. That disciplines spills  over onto <em>everyday life</em> situations. Even though I am an autodidact and enjoy teaching myself I could not settle down to learn coding on my own. I needed confirmation on my problems  quickly. I live interaction with an instructor while I learn to code. I concluded that I needed to learn coding in a classroom environment. I am wired to keep tinkering with a task until it's completed. I often loose contact with earth when I am involved deep concentratiuon tasks. I'm able to binge on a task until 2 AM on consecutive nights in a row fixing a bug or solving a problem. I'd go to bed dreaming of it and wake up with an answer to the problem. Then have the ability to shake it off and start fresh. <em>I do not give up easily.</em> I am fearless and I'm at the age where I am not afraid to make a mistake and ask too many questions. I see the Craft of Coding becoming as my <em>life-long</em> Hobby.<br>
       
       <br>

I am currently able to set aside three months of my life to devote <strong>as many hours as required for Bootcamp. </strong>I will work well within a team as well as solo. My written and verbal communication skills are up to par.  Who am I kidding? My destination while in bootcamp is <stronge>100%</stronge> <em>unknown.</em> However, what I know for sure is that I ain't no stink'n quitter! I'm willing Google the hell out of a problem! I am preparing myself <stronge>a life-time of alls</stronge> all-dayers  <em>and</em> all nighters. <br>
       <br>
       Even as I sit here  Sunday morning at 4:10am for the 3rd consecutive night constantly revising placement and rewriting mistakes, I notice that I feel energerized, but no fear.  I feel  a little frustrated and I feel like chucking I and starting anew. I'm excited to get this done correctly. I'm not frustrated enough to quit. I feel more determined to work out the kinks. I feel confident that I'll figure this out in the end. This reassures me tht I have chosen the correct path! It simply feels <em>right.</em> <br>
       <br>
       I'm looking forward to gaining knowledge that will make the simple problems that I'm experiencing now...a breeze! So, I have my <em>life jacket secured</em> and I'm ready to go <em>toe-dipping</em> in the ocean! </h3
